# Bookmark Toggle

## Task

Take a look at the webpage. You will find a single question card. Your task is to make the bookmark icon interactive. That means:

- if the bookmark is inactive, switch it to be active (displaying in red).
- if the bookmark is active, switch it back to the inactive version (empty with white outline).

If you look into the css for the bookmark, you will find two classes: `bookmark__icon` and `bookmark__icon--active`. If you add the second class manually to the `svg` element in the html, you will see that the bookmark is now presented as active.

How can you use the bookmark button and the `--active` class to add / remove the active visuals when clicking the button? (Hint: take a look at `classlist.toggle`!)

Good luck!
